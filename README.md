#opinion-domain-lexicon-acquisition#


This toolkit allows to generate domain specific lexicons:
* Polarity or expression lexicons: lexicons with words in the specific domain used to state opinions
* Target or property lexicons: lexicons with expressions that represent properties of the entities
represented in the given domain (for a hotel review domain, these properties could be the rooms, the staff
or the ambience). 

Usually the polarity expressions are used to give opinions about properties.

Two approaches for automatically generating these domains have been implemented
and are available within this toolkit:
* Supervised acquisition: from domain annotated data
* Unsupervised acquisition: from raw data belonging to the domain
